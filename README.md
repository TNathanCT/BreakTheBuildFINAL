About our project:
The Devil Is In The Details
First person adventure/quest and puzzles game.
Dropped in the garden of a country manor you have to find the three lost garden gnomes while being chased by the Tarman, a cruel and relentless monster. You are helped in this task by a pair of magical spectacles that reveal indications and clues. While you are wearing the specs, you can't see the monster chasing you. Luckily he is quite vocal.
